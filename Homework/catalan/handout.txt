Using example from class - calculation of classical Catalan number,
implement 
catalan3( int N ) - number of trees of size N with branching factor 3
catalan4( int N ) - number of trees of size N with branching factor 4

Extra credit:
catalan( int N, int b)
number of trees of size N with branching factor b.

Idea: by implementing catalan3 and catalan4 you should have noticed that you
will need an unknown number (b) of nested loops. This is possible with (another)
recursion.
